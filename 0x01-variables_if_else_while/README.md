# The following is a brief discription of the programs in this directory:

## Program 1:
This program generates a random number and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero. The output is displayed as follows: "The number is positive" if the number is greater than 0, "The number is zero" if the number is 0, and "The number is negative" if the number is less than 0.

## Program 2:
This program generates a random number and prints the last digit of that number. It also provides additional information about the last digit: "Last digit of n is greater than 5" if the last digit is greater than 5, "Last digit of n is 0" if the last digit is 0, and "Last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0" if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0.

## Program 3:
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in order using the putchar function. It only uses putchar twice.

## Program 4:
This program prints the lowercase alphabet, followed by the uppercase alphabet, using the putchar function. It uses putchar three times.

## Program 5:
This program prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', using the putchar function. It uses putchar twice.

## Program 6:
This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 (from 0 to 9) using the putchar function.

## Program 7:
This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10 (from 0 to 9) using the putchar function. It does not use variables of type char and uses putchar twice.

## Program 8:
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using the putchar function. It uses putchar twice.

## Program 9:
This program prints all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase using the putchar function. It uses putchar three times.

## Program 10:
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas and a space. The numbers are printed in ascending order, and it uses the putchar function four times at most. No variables of type char are used.

## Program 11:
This program prints all possible combinations of different two digits, separated by commas and a space. The combinations are printed in ascending order, and it uses the putchar function five times at most. No variables of type char are used.

## Program 12:
This program prints all possible combinations of different three digits, separated by commas and a space. The combinations are printed in ascending order, and it uses the putchar function six times at most. No variables of type char are used.

## Program 13:
This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers from 0 to 99. The combinations are separated by commas and a space, and each number is displayed with two digits. The combinations are printed in ascending order, and it uses the putchar function eight times at most. No variables of type char are used.
